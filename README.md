# GCodePathMinimizer

This code repository contains a tool to minimize the travel distance of G-code paths used in CNC machining and 3D printing. The tool analyzes the G-code commands and rearranges them to reduce the overall movement of the machine head, leading to faster print times and reduced wear on the equipment.

The G-code to optimize are in folder [objets3D](./objets3D).

> Note: The G-code files come from PrusaSlicer software and have been refactored for better readability.
